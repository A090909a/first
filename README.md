Hi, I’m Abdullah Almuhaini. I’m a first-year Computer Science student, and I’m just starting my journey in coding. I made this GitHub to share my progress and learn as I go.

About Me

I’m new to programming, so I’m learning everything from the ground up. I like trying small exercises, practicing new ideas, and improving step by step. I’m not perfect at coding yet, but I’m doing my best and enjoying the process.

What I’m Learning

Basic programming skills

How to use Git and GitHub

Simple problem-solving in code

Python and basic web concepts

Projects

Most of my projects are small practice tasks from university. I’ll add more work as I learn and feel more confident.

My Goals

Get better at writing code

Build simple projects on my own

Understand programming more clearly

Improve little by little throughout the year
